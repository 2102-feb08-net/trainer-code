    <h2>External Stylesheets</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Now that we've discussed inline and internal stylesheet styling, let's talk
        about the most commonly used and best practice for styling - external stylesheets.
        Instead of specifying the styling for a page in the <code>head</code>, we
        can place our CSS in a separate <code>.css</code> file and reference it
        using the <code>link</code> tag. We use the <code>href</code> attribute
        to give the URL of the file, and the <code>rel</code> attribute specifies
        the relationship to the HTML document - for CSS, we use <code>stylesheet</code>.
        Here's a sample link tag from the <code>head</code> of this page:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./external.css"&gt;</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        And <a href="./external.css">here's a link</a> to the actual file.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's several advantages to using external stylesheets to style your page:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Separation of concerns - HTML and CSS are in separate documents, you don't have to mix them</li>
        <li>Reusability - the same stylesheet can be used to style many HTML files</li>
        <li>Central location - if you need to change styling, you can do so in one place instead of many</li>
        <li>Readability - your HTML will be less cluttered, and CSS styling easier to understand when they are separate</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Cascading Rules</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        What happens when you have two CSS rules that conflict with each other
        in the context of the HTML document - for example, consider the following CSS:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>div { color: red; }
        .green { color: green; }</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        What happens when you have the following HTML?
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>&lt;div class="green"&gt;hmmm...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        It turns out the text will be green! (Try it out and see)
      </p>
      <p>
        But how does the browser determine which CSS rules win out? The order that
        selectors are chosen for styling depending on a few things, listed below
        in order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Importance</li>
        <li>Specificity</li>
        <li>Source order</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Importance</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          There is a special CSS flag you can use to ensure that a style <strong>always</strong>
          gets applied - the <code>!important</code> flag. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>div { color: red !important; } /* this style will always be applied */</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The only way to override an <code>!important</code> flag is to apply another
          <code>!important</code> flag on a selector with the same specificity later
          in the document, or on a selector with greater specificity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Specificity</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Specificity</strong> is a measure of how <em>specific</em> a
          selector is - basically, how many elements this selector could match.
          The selector with the most specificity is favored and its styles will be
          applied over other selectors. Each kind of selector is listed below in
          order of most to least specific:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>No selector / inline (declared inside <code>style</code> attribute)</li>
          <li>ID selector</li>
          <li>Class / attribute / pseudo-class selector</li>
          <li>Element or pseudo-element selector</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Thus, if we have the following CSS styles, we can determine which will
          win out over the others:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>div { color: red; } /* least specific - won't be applied */
          #yellow { color: yellow; } /* most specific - this style will be applied */
          .green { color: green; } /* in the middle - won't be applied */</code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Source Order</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          If two selectors have the same importance level and specificity, then the
          determining factor for which style will be applied is <strong>the order
          in which the selectors were declared - later rules win over earlier ones</strong>.
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>div { color: blue; } /* This comes first, will lose */
          div { color: red; } /* this selector comes after, so we'll get this style applied */</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This is important to keep in mind in case you mix external stylesheets with
          an internal one, or if you important multiple external stylesheets -
          <strong>the order of importing matters if CSS rules conflict!</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          <em>It's important to note that the cascading rules are only applied
          when CSS properties are in conflict!</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Another concept you should be aware of in CSS is <strong>inheritance</strong>
        - the idea that certain property values of an element get passed down
        to child elements nested within them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <code>font-family</code> and <code>color</code> are inherited.
        This means you can set a <code>font-family</code> for the entire document
        by setting the property on the <code>html</code> or <code>body</code>
        element.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control inheritance with a few special values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>inherit</code> - get the property value from parent element</li>
        <li><code>initial</code> - sets the value to whatever the browser's default is</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also use the
        <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">all</a></code>
        keyword to set all of an element's properties at once.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Layout with CSS</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display</a></code>
        property is a crucial CSS property you should be aware of - it defines
        the <em>display type</em> of an element - whether it appears inline, as
        a block, a flexbox, or something else. Elements have default values defined
        for this property - for example, we already discussed that <code>div</code>
        elements display as blocks, and <code>span</code> elements are inline by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we can change the default behavior like below:
      </p>
      <pre><div style="margin-left: 50px">This is in a div. <div style="display: inline">This is in a different div but should be inline</div></div></pre>
      <p>
        A few common <code>display</code> values are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>inline</code> - display on the same line as other elements</li>
        <li><code>block</code> - start on a new line and </li>
        <li><code>flex</code> - make the element a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout">flexbox</a></li>
        <li><code>none</code> - do not display the element at all</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note: you can also use the <code>visibility: hidden</code> property to hide
        an element. <strong>The difference is that <code>display: none</code> removes the
        element from the page completely whereas <code>visibility: hidden</code> means
        that the tag is allocated space on the page, but just isn't seen.</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong><code>position</code></strong> property is another important property
        related to layout on a webpage. It governs the flow of elements - you can
        take elements out of the normal flow of the page to always appear on the same
        place on the screen, to appear on top of other elements, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some <code>position</code> property values you should know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>static</code> - this is the default value, the element is placed in the normal document flow</li>
        <li><code>relative</code> - the element occurs in its normal place, but can be moved around with <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> properties</li>
        <li><code>absolute</code> - removes the element from the normal flow of the document, fixes it in place relative to the <code>html</code> element or nearest positioned ancestor</li>
        <li><code>fixed</code> - fixes element in place relative to browser viewport (the window)</li>
        <li><code>sticky</code> - hybrid between <code>relative</code> and <code>fixed</code>, allowing relative positioning until scrolled to a threshold point</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should also be aware of the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
        <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> properties - these work with all
        <code>position</code> values except <code>static</code>. They tell where
        to move the positioned element to. When used with <code>position: relative</code>,
        they move the element <strong>away</strong> from the direction specified.
        So, <code>top: 5px</code> will push the element downwards by 5 pixels.
        Alternatively, use with <code>absolute</code> or <code>fixed</code> will
        specify the distance from the containing element's sides. So, <code>top: 5px</code>
        will position the element 5 pixels from the top of the containing element in
        this context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important layout property is <code>z-index</code>. When non-<code>static</code>
        elements overlap, we need a way to manage which get shown on top of others.
        Imagine in addition to horizontal and vertical x and y axes on the page,
        that there is a "z" axis projecting out from the screen. The <code>z-index</code>
        property controls how high on that z-axis an element is - elements with higher
        values are displayed on top of lower-valued elements. By default, positioned
        elements have a <code>z-index</code> of <code>0</code>.
      </p>

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        An important recent concept in web development is
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a></strong>
        - a way of designing web pages so that they render well on any window, screen,
        or device size, from mobile phones to tablets to large desktop monitors.
        Responsive web design has become increasingly important due to the share of
        internet traffic conducted from mobile phones and devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do we design web pages to change based on the size of the screen?
        There are a few ways to achieve this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use fluid grid systems - make your element containers sized with relative units like percentages instead of absolute units</li>
        <li>Use flexible images which are also sized relatively to prevent rendering outside their container</li>
        <li>Use <strong>media queries</strong> to change CSS based on the window size</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Media Queries</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">Media queries</a> are
          a way of using customized CSS for different screen sizes. They can be used
          to respond to different media types and features. An example of the syntax
          is shown below:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>@media screen and (min-device-width: 500px) {
            /* code in here only applies to screens equal or greater than 500 pixels wide */
            width: 100%;
          }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can reverse the rule and apply our CSS only if the screen is equal to or
          <strong>less than</strong> 500 pixels with the following media query:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>@media screen and (max-device-width: 500px) {
            /* code in here only applies to screens equal to or less than 500 pixels wide */
            width: 100%;
          }</code>
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>@ Rules</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A media query is one type of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule">at-rule</a> -
        which tell CSS what to do in some way. The most important ones are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>@media</code> - used for media queries</li>
        <li><code>@font-face</code> - used for defining a custom font</li>
        <li><code>@keyframes</code> - used for animations in CSS</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>CSS3</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        It's also important to know that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3">CSS3</a>
        is the most recent version of CSS and includes several of the modern features
        and benefits of using CSS, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>rounded corners</li>
        <li>shadows</li>
        <li>gradients</li>
        <li>transitions and animations</li>
        <li>flexbox layouts</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
